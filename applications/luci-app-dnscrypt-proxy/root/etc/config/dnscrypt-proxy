#
# Available options:
#
# enabled		<0|1>
#	enable the dnscrypt-proxy service or not.
# local_address		<ip>[:port]
#	what local IP the daemon will listen to, with an optional port. 
# edns_payload_size	<bytes>
#	transparently add an OPT pseudo-RR to outgoing  queries  in  order
#	to enable the EDNS0 extension mechanism. The payload size  is  the
#	size of the largest response we accept from  the  resolver  before
#	retrying over TCP. This feature is enabled by default, with a pay-
#	load size of 1252 bytes. Any value below 512 disables it.
# provider_key		<key>
#	specify the provider public key.
# logfile		<file>
#	log events to this file instead of the standard output.
# loglevel		<level>
#	don't log events with priority above this level after the  service
#	has been started up. Default is the value for LOG_INFO.
# max_active_requests	<count>
#	set the  maximum  number  of  simultaneous  active  requests.  The 
#	default value is 250.
# resolver_address	<ip>[:port]
#	a DNSCrypt-capable resolver IP address with an optional  port. The
#	default port is 443.
# user			<username>
#	run the dnscrypt-proxy service as the user, default is "nobody".
# provider_name		<FQDN>
#	the fully-qualified name of the dnscrypt certificate provider.
# tcp_only		<0|1>
#	always use TCP. A connection made using UDP will get  a  truncated
#	response, so that the (stub) resolver retries using TCP.
